# Python AI Agents

This repository contains cookbook examples from Datalumina® that I am using to explore AI agent workflow patterns. These examples and tutorials provide helpful resources for developers building AI systems, with copy/paste code snippets that can be easily integrated into various projects.

## Original Source

These examples are based on the [AI Cookbook](https://github.com/daveebbelaar/ai-cookbook) by Dave Ebbelaar, AI Engineer and founder of Datalumina®. The original content includes practical tutorials that teach developers how to build AI systems that work in real-world applications.

## My Learning Focus

I'm specifically exploring:
- AI agent workflow patterns
- Implementation techniques for autonomous agents
- Integration of different AI capabilities
- Practical applications of AI agent architectures
